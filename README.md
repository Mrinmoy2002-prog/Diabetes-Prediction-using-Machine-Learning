# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Developed a machine learning model using
neural networks to predict severity levels of Diabetic's disease. Conducted data pre-processing,
including feature selection and normalization, to prepare data for accurate model training. Trained and
evaluated the model, optimizing performance to enhance prediction accuracy.
